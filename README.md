  Site Project for School using WordPress Themes and Functionality: "The assignment consists of you developing a brand new site (incl. your own WordPress theme) for a customer who wants to be able to publish recipes under different categories."

---------------------------------------

## RESOURCES:

 - [theHiveResistance](https://wcm20.thehiveresistance.com/cms-saf-inlamningsuppgift/) : Assignment Blog
 - [github](https://trello.com/b/asHlJEdX/instalit) : Repository for the Theme

---------------------------------------

## NOTES AND MUSINGS

- Always doublecheck if SCSS Compiler is on. Would save SO much headache.
- More SCSS practice to keep from going into too deep into "nesting hell".
- WP Handbook: lifesaver.
- underscores: good!
- learn react: learn gutenburg. 
- next time, just use the theme hero img instead of using gutenburg feature, bc the content padding will affect hero images made in gutenburg (with current css, at least)

---------------------------------------
